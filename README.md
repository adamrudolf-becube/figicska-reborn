# Figicska reborn

An old code added to GitHub years later it was written. Code was written in 2016. Sorry for not including any instructions or descriptions, the purpose of this repo is to save the code to the future in a presentable way. As I remember I used Visual Studio to develop it.

This is a C# rewrite of the 2006 Pascal project [figicska](https://github.com/adamrudolf-becube/figicska). I did it to learn C# and the concept of separate GUI from logic and create a console and a graphicl implementation which are interchangable and use the same backend. I never finished it, but put some efforts in it.
